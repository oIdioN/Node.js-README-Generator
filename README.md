<h1 align="center">Node.js README.md Generator</h1>


  <p align="center">
   With this generator a user can create a README file by using a command-line application.<br>
   This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.<br>
   The project uses Javascript and runs on Node.js using "inquirer" and "fs" for file manipulation.</p>

### Prerequisites

    Create a command-line application that accepts user input.

    When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

        The title of my project

        Sections entitled:

        Description

        Table of Contents

        Installation

        Usage

        License

        Contributing

        Tests

        Questions

    When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

    When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

    When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

    When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

    When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

    When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
