<h3 align="center">README-Generator</h3>

  <p align="center">
   With this Readme generator the user can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.  
   This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.  
   The project uses Javascript and runs on Node.js using "inquirer" and "fs" for file manipulation.</p>

### Prerequisites

    Create a command-line application that accepts user input.

    When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with:

        The title of my project

        Sections entitled:

        Description

        Table of Contents

        Installation

        Usage

        License

        Contributing

        Tests

        Questions

    When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

    When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

    When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

    When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

    When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

    When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
